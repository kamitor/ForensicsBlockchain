# Recovery of Lost NFT Procedure

This document provides a comprehensive guide for attempting to recover a lost NFT (Non-Fungible Token) or investigating its disappearance, designed for individuals with basic IT and forensic skills but no prior knowledge of NFTs or blockchain. Please follow these instructions carefully to maximize the chances of successful recovery.

## Step 1: Gather Information

Collect as much information as possible about the lost NFT and the circumstances surrounding its loss.

-   **NFT Platform**: Identify the platform where the NFT was purchased or stored (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain).
-   **NFT Name/ID**: Locate and note the specific name or ID of the lost NFT.
-   **Wallet Address**: Find out the wallet address where the NFT was stored.
-   **Associated Transactions/Events**: Ask the individual for any related transactions or events they remember.
-   **Date and Time of Loss**: Determine the approximate date and time when the NFT was last seen.

## Step 2: Check the Blockchain Explorer

Use a blockchain explorer specific to the blockchain where the NFT was stored to look up the associated wallet address and transaction history.

-   **Blockchain Explorer**: Open your web browser and go to the relevant blockchain explorer (e.g., Etherscan for Ethereum). You can typically find the official explorer by searching for "Blockchain Explorer [Blockchain Name]."
    
-   **Search for Wallet Address**: On the blockchain explorer's homepage, there should be a search bar or field. Enter the wallet address associated with the lost NFT and hit "Search."
    
-   **Review Transaction History**: The blockchain explorer will display the transaction history for that wallet address. Look for any transactions related to the lost NFT. Transactions involving NFTs are often labeled with the NFT's name or ID.
    
    **Example**: If you're using Etherscan for Ethereum, you'll see a list of transactions with details like block numbers, timestamps, and transaction values. Focus on transactions involving the NFT in question.
    

## Step 3: Transaction History Analysis

Examine the transaction history in detail to identify any suspicious or unexpected transfers related to the lost NFT.

-   **Check Outgoing Transfers**: Look for any transfers of the NFT from the wallet address. Note down the destination addresses and the date/time of these transfers.
-   **Check Incoming Transfers**: Check if the NFT was ever transferred into the wallet from another address.
-   **Note Other Transactions**: Pay attention to any interactions with smart contracts or other NFT-related activities.

## Step 4: Contact the NFT Platform

Reach out to the customer support or help center of the NFT platform where the NFT was purchased or stored.

-   **Customer Support Contact**: Visit the official website of the NFT platform and locate their customer support or contact information. Send them a detailed message explaining the situation and providing all the information you've gathered.

## Step 5: Report the Incident

If there is evidence of unauthorized access or a scam, report the incident to the appropriate authorities or law enforcement agencies in your jurisdiction.

-   **Contact Local Authorities**: Locate the contact information for your local law enforcement agency or cybercrime division. Provide them with all the information you have about the incident, including wallet addresses and transaction details.

## Step 6: Engage with Online Communities

Participate in blockchain and NFT communities to share details of the incident and seek assistance or insights from community members.

-   **Join Online Forums**: Register on popular forums like Reddit's r/CryptoCurrency or dedicated blockchain and NFT communities. Create a post detailing the situation and include relevant information.

## Step 7: Use Forensics Tools


### Substep 1: Research and Identify Forensic Tools

1.  **Research Forensic Tools**: Begin by researching and identifying forensic tools that can assist in analyzing blockchain transactions. Some popular tools include Chainalysis, CipherTrace, and Elliptic.
